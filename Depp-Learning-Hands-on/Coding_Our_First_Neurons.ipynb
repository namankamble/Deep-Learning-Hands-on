    "#### **Now, what is an array?**\n",
    "We define an array as an ordered homologous container for numbers, and mostly use this term when working with the NumPy package since that is what the main data structure is called within it. A linear array, also called a 1-dimensional array, is the simplest example of an array, and in plain Python, this would be a list. Arrays can also consist of multi-dimensional data, and one of the best-known examples is what we call a matrix in mathematics, which we will represent as a 2-dimensional array. Each element of the array can be \n",

    "the same properties as a vector, but, just as we can write a matrix as a list of lists in Python, we can also write a vector as a list or an array! Additionally, we will look at the vector algebraically (mathematically) as a set of numbers in brackets. This is in contrast to the physics perspective, where the vector’s representation is usually seen as an arrow, characterized by a magnitude and \n",
